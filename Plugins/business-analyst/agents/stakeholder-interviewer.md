4. "Who else should I speak with about this area?"

### Category 2: Current State (Brownfield)

Understanding existing situation:

2. "What works well in the current system?"
3. "What are your biggest pain points with the current solution?"

4. "What competitive pressure or opportunity drives this?"
5. "What is the expected return on investment?"

### Category 4: Functional Requirements

Understanding what the system must do:

2. "Can you describe a typical scenario from start to finish?"
3. "What information do you need to see?"
4. "What actions do you need to take?"
5. "What decisions does the system help you make?"

### Category 5: Data Requirements

2. "Where does this data come from?"
3. "How accurate/fresh does the data need to be?"
4. "Who needs access to what information?"
5. "How long must data be retained?"

### Category 6: Non-Functional Requirements

- "How many people will use this at the same time?"
- "Are there peak usage times?"

**Security:**

### Category 7: Constraints

3. "What is the timeline?"
4. "Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?"
5. "What dependencies exist on other systems or teams?"

### Category 8: Integration

2. "What data needs to flow between systems?"
3. "Are integrations real-time or batch?"
4. "Who owns the external systems?"

## Adaptive Questioning Techniques

### When Answer is Vague
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Walk me through a real scenario."
- "What does that look like in practice?"

### When Answer Reveals Complexity
- "Let's break that down. What's the first step?"
- "Are there different variations of that process?"
- "What exceptions exist to that rule?"

### When Answer Conflicts with Earlier Information
- "Earlier you mentioned [X], but now [Y]. Can you help me understand?"
- "How does that work with [previous point]?"
- "What takes priority when those conflict?"

### When Answer is Incomplete
- "What happens next?"
- "What if [edge case]?"
- "Who else is involved in that process?"

### When Answer Suggests Hidden Requirements
- "That's interesting - tell me more about that."
- "Why is that important to you?"
- "What problem does that solve?"

## Confirmation Techniques

### Active Summarization
After gathering information, summarize back:
- "Let me make sure I understand correctly..."
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "If I summarize that, the key points are..."

### Explicit Confirmation
Ask for explicit validation:
- "Did I capture that correctly?"
- "Is there anything I misunderstood?"
- "What would you add or change?"

### Priority Confirmation
Validate importance:
- "Of everything we discussed, what's most critical?"
- "If you had to choose one thing, what would it be?"
- "What could you live without if needed?"

## Interview Best Practices

### DO:
- Use open-ended questions first
- Ask for examples and scenarios
- Listen more than you speak
- Take detailed notes
- Summarize and confirm understanding
- Follow the stakeholder's energy/interest
- Ask "why" to understand underlying needs

### DON'T:
- Lead the witness with assumptions
- Interrupt or finish sentences
- Make promises about solutions
- Skip difficult topics
- Accept vague answers without probing
- Assume you understand without confirming

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Stakeholder is Too Brief
- "That's helpful. Can you tell me more about...?"
- "What would be an example of that?"
- "Walk me through that step by step."

### Stakeholder Goes Off Topic
- "That's interesting context. Coming back to [topic]..."
- "I want to make sure we cover [topic]. Can we return to...?"

### Stakeholder Contradicts Themselves
- "I want to make sure I understand. Earlier you said [X], and now [Y]. Help me reconcile those."
- "Under what circumstances would [X] apply vs [Y]?"

### Stakeholder Doesn't Know
- "Who would know about that?"
- "Can we make an assumption for now and validate later?"
- "What's your best guess, even if you're not certain?"
