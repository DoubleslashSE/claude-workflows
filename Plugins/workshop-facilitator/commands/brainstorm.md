## Pre-Session Setup

### Context Gathering

Before starting:

1. **Topic**: What are we brainstorming about?
2. **Goal**: What kind of ideas are we looking for?
   - New product/feature ideas?
   - Solutions to a problem?
   - Creative approaches?
   - Names/titles?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any boundaries to respect?
4. **Duration**: How much time do we have?

**Standard Session**: 60 minutes
- Setup & Rules: 5 min
- Round 1 (Free): 10 min
- Round 2 (Prompted): 15 min
- Round 3 (Wild): 10 min
- Grouping: 10 min
- Voting & Close: 10 min

**Quick Session**: 30 minutes (compressed)
**Extended Session**: 90+ minutes (deeper exploration)

## Opening (5 min)

```markdown
## Brainstorming Session

**Topic**: [TOPIC]
**Goal**: Generate [TYPE] ideas for [PURPOSE]
**Target**: [NUMBER] ideas minimum

**Ground Rules**:
1. **Defer judgment** - No criticizing ideas during generation
2. **Quantity over quality** - More ideas = more options
3. **Build on ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." to extend others' thoughts
4. **Encourage wild ideas** - They often lead to practical ones
5. **Stay focused** - Keep ideas relevant to the topic

Ready to begin?
```

## Round 1: Free Association (10 min)

**Purpose**: Get ideas flowing without constraints.

### Activity

"Share whatever comes to mind related to [TOPIC]. Don't filter - let ideas flow freely."

**Prompts to keep momentum**:
- "What else?"
- "Keep going..."
- "What about..."
- "And if we consider..."

### Capture Format
```
## Round 1 Ideas
1. [Idea]
2. [Idea]
3. [Idea]
...
```

### Energy Check
If ideas slow down:
- "Think about this from a different angle..."
- "What would [persona] suggest?"
- "What's the opposite of what we've said?"

### Checkpoint
"We've captured [N] ideas in Round 1. Highlights:
- [Notable idea 1]
- [Notable idea 2]

Would you like to:
- **Continue free association** with a different angle?
- **Move to prompted ideation** to explore specific directions?
- **Jump to wild ideas** to push boundaries?"

## Round 2: Prompted Ideation (15 min)

**Purpose**: Use structured prompts to explore specific directions.

### Technique Options

#### Option A: SCAMPER Method
Apply each lens to the topic:

| Lens | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| **S**ubstitute | What could we replace or swap? |
| **C**ombine | What could we merge or integrate? |
| **A**dapt | What could we copy from elsewhere? |
| **M**odify | What could we enlarge, minimize, or change? |
| **P**ut to other use | What else could this be used for? |
| **E**liminate | What could we remove or simplify? |
| **R**everse | What could we flip or rearrange? |

#### Option B: Perspective Shifting
Generate ideas from different viewpoints:
- "What would a child suggest?"
- "What would a competitor do?"
- "What would someone from a different industry try?"
- "What would future you (10 years from now) recommend?"

#### Option C: Constraint Addition
Add provocative constraints:
- "What if we had unlimited budget?"
- "What if we had to do it in one day?"
- "What if it had to be free?"
- "What if it had to work offline?"

#### Option D: Analogies
Draw inspiration from other domains:
- "How does nature solve this?"
- "How does [industry X] handle this?"
- "What would this look like in a game?"

### Prompted Ideas Capture
```
## Round 2 Ideas (Prompted)

### [Technique Used]
1. [Idea from prompt 1]
2. [Idea from prompt 2]
...
```

### Checkpoint
"Using [TECHNIQUE], we generated [N] more ideas. New themes emerging:
- [Theme 1]
- [Theme 2]

Would you like to:
- **Try another technique**?
- **Dive deeper** into any theme?
- **Proceed to wild ideas**?"

## Round 3: Wild Ideas (10 min)

**Purpose**: Push beyond conventional thinking.

### Activity

"Now let's get wild. No practical limits. What crazy, impossible, or extreme ideas come to mind?"

**Provocations**:
- "What would get us fired (but might actually work)?"
- "What's the most expensive solution?"
- "What's the most ridiculous approach?"
- "What would a supervillain do?"
- "What if we did the exact opposite of the norm?"
- "What would this look like in 100 years?"

### Wild Ideas Capture
```
## Round 3 Ideas (Wild)
1. [Wild idea] 💡
2. [Wild idea] 💡
...

**Hidden gems in wild ideas**:
- [Element from wild idea that might actually work]
```

### Mining Wild Ideas
"Looking at our wild ideas, what elements could we extract for practical use?"

### Checkpoint
"Our wild round produced [N] ideas. Some interesting elements:
- [Extractable element 1]
- [Extractable element 2]

Ready to organize and prioritize all our ideas?"

## Grouping & Theming (10 min)

**Purpose**: Organize ideas into coherent themes.

### Activity

"Let me organize our [TOTAL] ideas into themes..."

```markdown
## Idea Themes

### Theme 1: [Name]
Description: [What unifies these ideas]
Ideas:
- [Idea A]
- [Idea B]
- [Idea C]

### Theme 2: [Name]
Description: [What unifies these ideas]
Ideas:
- [Idea D]
- [Idea E]

### Theme 3: [Name]
...

### Standalone Ideas
Ideas that don't fit a theme but are notable:
- [Idea X]
- [Idea Y]
```

### Checkpoint
"I've grouped our ideas into [N] themes:
1. **[Theme 1]**: [N] ideas about [description]
2. **[Theme 2]**: [N] ideas about [description]
3. **[Theme 3]**: [N] ideas about [description]

Do these groupings make sense? Should we:
- **Reorganize** any ideas?
- **Add a theme** we missed?
- **Proceed to voting**?"

## Voting & Prioritization (10 min)

**Purpose**: Identify the most promising ideas.

### Voting Methods

#### Option A: Top 3 Selection
"Which 3 ideas resonate most strongly with you?"

#### Option B: Dot Voting
"Distribute 5 votes among ideas. You can put multiple votes on one idea."

#### Option C: Criteria-Based
Rate ideas against criteria:
- Impact potential (1-5)
- Feasibility (1-5)
- Originality (1-5)

### Results
```markdown
## Voting Results

| Rank | Idea | Votes/Score | Theme |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | [Idea] | [N] | [Theme] |
| 2 | [Idea] | [N] | [Theme] |
| 3 | [Idea] | [N] | [Theme] |
| 4 | [Idea] | [N] | [Theme] |
| 5 | [Idea] | [N] | [Theme] |
```

### Checkpoint
"Based on voting, here are the top priorities:
1. **[Idea 1]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Idea 2]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Idea 3]**: [Brief description]

Does this ranking feel right? Any ideas that should be higher?"
