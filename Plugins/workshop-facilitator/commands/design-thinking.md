# Design Thinking Workshop

Execute a Design Thinking workshop for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Design Thinking Overview

Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that follows five phases:

## Pre-Workshop Setup

### Context Gathering

Before starting, clarify:

1. **The Challenge**: What problem or opportunity are we exploring?
2. **The User**: Who are we designing for?
3. **The Context**: What do we know about the current situation?
4. **The Constraints**: What limitations exist?
5. **The Scope**: How much time do we have?

**Standard Duration**: 90 minutes
- Empathize: 15 min
- Define: 10 min
- Ideate: 25 min
- Prototype: 20 min
- Feedback: 15 min
- Close: 5 min

**Quick Format**: 60 minutes (compressed timings)
**Deep Dive**: 2-3 hours (expanded exploration)

## Phase 1: Empathize (15 min)

**Purpose**: Understand the user and their needs deeply.

### Activities

#### User Perspective Mapping
"Let's step into the user's shoes. Think about:
- Who is the user we're designing for?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What frustrates them about the current situation?
- What would delight them?"

**Prompts**:
- "Describe a day in the life of your user..."
- "What keeps this user up at night regarding [topic]?"
- "What workarounds do they currently use?"
- "When was the last time they were frustrated by this?"

#### Empathy Mapping

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Checkpoint
"We've explored the user perspective. Key insights:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

Would you like to:
- **Dive deeper** into any aspect of the user experience?
- **Explore a different user segment**?
- **Proceed** to Define?"

## Phase 2: Define (10 min)

**Purpose**: Synthesize learnings into a clear problem statement.

### Activities

#### Problem Statement Creation

Use the "How Might We" (HMW) format:

"Based on our empathy work, let's frame the problem. A good problem statement:
- Is focused on the user
- Doesn't prescribe a solution
- Is neither too broad nor too narrow"

**Formula**:
```
How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?
```

**Examples**:
- "How might we reduce checkout friction for new customers so that they complete their first purchase?"
- "How might we help remote teams feel connected so that they collaborate more effectively?"

#### Point of View Statement

```
[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT]
```

### Problem Statement Refinement

Present options:
1. HMW: [Option A]
2. HMW: [Option B]
3. HMW: [Option C]

### Checkpoint
"Here's our problem statement: **[HMW STATEMENT]**

Does this capture the challenge well? Should we:
- **Refine** the statement?
- **Broaden or narrow** the scope?
- **Proceed** to Ideate?"

## Phase 3: Ideate (25 min)

**Purpose**: Generate a wide range of potential solutions.

### Ground Rules
"Now we brainstorm solutions. Remember:
- Defer judgment - all ideas welcome
- Go for quantity
- Build on others' ideas
- Encourage wild ideas"

### Activities

#### Round 1: Individual Ideation (5 min)
"Silently generate as many ideas as possible. Don't filter - write everything down."

**Prompt**: "What solutions come to mind for: [HMW]?"

#### Round 2: Share and Build (10 min)
"Share your ideas. As you hear others, think 'Yes, and...' to build on them."

Capture all ideas:
1. [Idea]
2. [Idea]
...

#### Round 3: Wild Ideas (5 min)
"Now push further. What if:
- Money was no object?
- You had unlimited time?
- Technology could do anything?
- You could break any rule?"

#### Round 4: Combine and Evolve (5 min)
"Look at our ideas. Can we combine any? What patterns emerge?"

### Checkpoint
"We've generated [N] ideas. Themes I see:
- [Theme 1]: [Ideas in this theme]
- [Theme 2]: [Ideas in this theme]

Would you like to:
- **Generate more ideas** in a specific direction?
- **Explore a wild idea** further?
- **Proceed** to Prototype?"

## Phase 4: Prototype (20 min)

**Purpose**: Make ideas tangible and testable.

### Selecting Ideas to Prototype

"Let's select 2-3 ideas to develop further. Which ideas have the most potential?"

**Selection Criteria**:
- Feasibility: Can we actually do this?
- Desirability: Would users want this?
- Viability: Does it make business sense?

### Conceptual Prototyping

For each selected idea, develop:

```markdown
## Concept: [Idea Name]

**Description**: [What is it in 1-2 sentences]

**How it works**:
1. [Step 1 of user experience]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Key features**:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

**What makes it special**:
[Unique value proposition]

**Biggest risk/assumption**:
[What needs to be true for this to work]
```

### Checkpoint
"Here are our prototyped concepts:

**Concept A**: [Name] - [Brief description]
**Concept B**: [Name] - [Brief description]

Would you like to:
- **Develop any concept further**?
- **Add another concept**?
- **Proceed** to Feedback?"

## Phase 5: Feedback (15 min)

**Purpose**: Test concepts and refine based on input.

### Feedback Framework

For each concept:

"Thinking about [CONCEPT], consider:
- **What I like** about this...
- **What I wish** was different...
- **What I wonder** about...
- **What if** we also..."

### Concept Critique

```markdown
## Feedback: [Concept Name]

**Strengths (Like)**:
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]

**Improvements (Wish)**:
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

**Questions (Wonder)**:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

**Extensions (What If)**:
- [Extension 1]
- [Extension 2]
```

### Concept Refinement

Based on feedback, refine concepts:
- What changes would strengthen this?
- Should we combine elements from different concepts?
- What should we test first?

### Checkpoint
"Based on feedback, here's how the concepts have evolved:

**[Concept A]**: [How it changed]
**[Concept B]**: [How it changed]

Would you like to:
- **Iterate** on any concept?
- **Combine** concepts?
- **Proceed** to closing and action planning?"

## Phase 6: Closing & Actions

### Synthesis

"Let's capture what we've created:

**Problem Statement**: [HMW]

**Top Solutions**:
1. [Concept 1] - [Key value]
2. [Concept 2] - [Key value]

**Key Insights**:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]"

### Action Planning

"What are the next steps to move these ideas forward?"

For each priority concept:
- What's the first action?
- Who will own it?
- What's the timeline?

### Documentation

Generate session artifacts:
- All ideas generated
- Problem statements considered
- Concepts developed
- Feedback received
- Action items
