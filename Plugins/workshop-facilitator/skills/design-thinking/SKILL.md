# Design Thinking Skill

## Overview

Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation and problem-solving. It integrates the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

## The Five Phases

### 1. Empathize

**Purpose**: Understand the people you're designing for.

**Key Activities**:
- User interviews
- Observation
- Immersive experiences
- Empathy mapping

**Outputs**:
- User insights
- Empathy maps
- User journey maps
- Pain points and gains

**Key Questions**:
- Who is the user?
- What do they need?
- What frustrates them?
- What delights them?
- What are their goals?

### 2. Define

**Purpose**: Synthesize findings into a clear problem statement.

**Key Activities**:
- Insight synthesis
- Problem framing
- Point of View (POV) statements
- "How Might We" questions

**Outputs**:
- Problem statement
- POV statement
- HMW questions
- Design challenge

**Frameworks**:

**POV Statement**:
```
[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT]
```

**How Might We (HMW)**:
```
How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?
```

### 3. Ideate

**Purpose**: Generate a wide range of potential solutions.

**Key Activities**:
- Brainstorming
- Mind mapping
- Sketching
- SCAMPER technique
- Worst possible idea

**Outputs**:
- Idea bank
- Concept sketches
- Clustered themes
- Selected concepts for prototyping

**Rules for Ideation**:
1. Defer judgment
2. Encourage wild ideas
3. Build on others' ideas
4. Stay focused on topic
5. One conversation at a time
6. Be visual
7. Go for quantity

### 4. Prototype

**Purpose**: Create representations of solutions to explore.

**Key Activities**:
- Sketching
- Storyboarding
- Role-playing
- Paper prototypes
- Digital mockups

**Outputs**:
- Prototypes (any fidelity)
- Storyboards
- Scenarios
- Physical or digital models

**Prototype Principles**:
- Start rough, refine later
- Build to think
- Fail fast, learn faster
- Prototype to learn, not to prove

### 5. Test

**Purpose**: Gather feedback and refine solutions.

**Key Activities**:
- User testing
- Feedback sessions
- Observation
- Iteration

**Outputs**:
- Feedback synthesis
- Refined prototypes
- Iteration plans
- Validated concepts

**Feedback Framework**:
- What I like...
- What I wish...
- What I wonder...
- What if...

## Design Thinking Mindsets

### 1. Human-Centered
Always start with people and their needs.

### 2. Bias Toward Action
Build to think. Don't just talk about ideas.

### 3. Radical Collaboration
Diverse perspectives lead to better solutions.

### 4. Culture of Prototyping
Make ideas tangible early and often.

### 5. Show, Don't Tell
Use visuals, stories, and prototypes.

### 6. Mindful of Process
Know where you are in the process.

### 7. Embrace Ambiguity
Stay open even when unclear.

```

### User Journey Map
```
PHASE:    Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Use → Loyalty
ACTIONS:  [What user does at each stage]
THOUGHTS: [What user thinks]
EMOTIONS: [How user feels - graph line]
PAIN PTS: [Friction points]
OPPTYS:   [Opportunities to improve]
```

## When to Use Design Thinking

**Best For**:
- Complex, ill-defined problems
- Human-centered challenges
- Innovation and new product development
- Experience design
- Service design

**Less Suitable For**:
- Well-defined technical problems
- Urgent decisions with no time for exploration
- Problems with clear, known solutions
