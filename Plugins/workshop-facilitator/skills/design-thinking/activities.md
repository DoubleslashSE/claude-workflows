### Activity: Empathy Mapping

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Purpose**: Synthesize observations into user understanding.

**Process**:
1. Draw the empathy map template
2. Fill in each quadrant based on research:
   - **Says**: Direct quotes
   - **Thinks**: Beliefs and attitudes
   - **Does**: Observable behaviors
   - **Feels**: Emotions
3. Identify Pains and Gains
4. Look for inconsistencies (say vs do)

### Activity: User Journey Mapping

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

**Purpose**: Visualize the user's experience over time.

**Process**:
1. Define the scope (start/end points)
2. List the phases/stages
3. For each stage, capture:
   - Actions
   - Thoughts
   - Emotions (plot as graph)
   - Touchpoints
   - Pain points
   - Opportunities
4. Identify moments of truth

## Define Phase Activities

### Activity: Point of View Madlib

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Purpose**: Create actionable problem statements.

**Template**:
```
[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT]
```

**Process**:
1. List user characteristics
2. Identify their core needs (verbs, not nouns)
3. Connect to surprising insights
4. Write 3-5 variations
5. Select the most compelling

**Examples**:
- "Working parents need efficient meal solutions because they value quality family time over cooking."
- "New graduates need professional confidence because they have expertise but lack experience signals."

### Activity: How Might We (HMW)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Purpose**: Transform problems into opportunities.

**Process**:
1. Start with POV statement
2. Reframe as HMW questions
3. Generate multiple HMWs from different angles:
   - Amplify the positive
   - Explore the opposite
   - Question assumptions
   - Change context
   - Break it into pieces

**Rules**:
- Not too broad (overwhelming)
- Not too narrow (limiting)
- Does not suggest solution

**Example Progression**:
- POV: "Busy commuters need quick healthy meals because they have no time to cook."
- Too Broad: "How might we solve hunger?"
- Too Narrow: "How might we make microwaveable salads?"
- Just Right: "How might we help busy commuters eat healthy without preparation time?"

## Ideate Phase Activities

### Activity: Classic Brainstorm

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Setup**:
- Clear HMW question visible
- Sticky notes and markers
- Timer

**Process**:
1. Review rules (defer judgment, build, quantity)
2. Silent ideation (3-5 min)
3. Round robin sharing
4. Building phase (respond with "Yes, and...")
5. Wild ideas push
6. Cluster similar ideas

### Activity: Worst Possible Idea

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Purpose**: Lower barriers, uncover assumptions.

**Process**:
1. Ask: "What's the worst possible solution?"
2. Generate terrible ideas enthusiastically
3. Examine what makes them terrible
4. Flip the terrible elements
5. Use flipped elements as inspiration

### Activity: SCAMPER

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Purpose**: Systematic exploration of modifications.

Apply each lens to existing ideas/products:

| Lens | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **S**ubstitute | What can we replace? Different materials, people, processes? |
| **C**ombine | What can we merge? Combine with other products, services? |
| **A**dapt | What can we borrow? From other industries, nature, history? |
| **M**odify | What can we change? Size, color, form, meaning? |
| **P**ut to other use | Other contexts? Different users? New applications? |
| **E**liminate | What can we remove? Simplify, reduce? |
| **R**everse | What can we flip? Order, perspective, roles? |

## Prototype Phase Activities

### Activity: Rapid Sketching

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Purpose**: Quickly visualize ideas.

**Process**:
1. Fold paper into 6-8 frames
2. Set timer for 1-2 minutes per frame
3. Sketch variations of the idea
4. No erasing allowed
5. Label key features
6. Share and discuss

### Activity: Storyboarding

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Purpose**: Show the user experience over time.

**Process**:
1. Define the scenario
2. Create 6-8 frames showing:
   - Frame 1: Context/setup
   - Frames 2-6: Key interactions
   - Frame 7-8: Outcome/resolution
3. Include:
   - User actions
   - System responses
   - Emotional states

3. Act out the scenario
4. Pause to note observations
5. Try variations
6. Debrief

## Test Phase Activities

### Activity: I Like, I Wish, What If

   - Green: "I like..." (positive)
   - Pink: "I wish..." (improvements)
   - Blue: "What if..." (new ideas)

5. Prioritize changes

### Activity: Think Aloud Testing

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes per test

   - Where they struggle
   - What they misunderstand
   - What delights them
5. Ask follow-up questions

### Activity: Feedback Capture Grid

```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│       LIKES (+)         │     CRITICISMS (-)      │
