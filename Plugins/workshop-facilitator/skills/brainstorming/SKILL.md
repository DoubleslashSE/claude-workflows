# Brainstorming Skill

## Overview

Brainstorming is a creative technique for generating ideas through group or individual thinking sessions. Effective brainstorming balances divergent thinking (generating many ideas) with convergent thinking (selecting the best ideas).

## Core Principles

### Osborn's Rules (Classic Brainstorming)

1. **Defer Judgment**: No criticism during idea generation
2. **Go for Quantity**: More ideas = more chances for good ones
3. **Encourage Wild Ideas**: They often contain seeds of innovation
4. **Build on Ideas**: Use "Yes, and..." to extend thoughts

### Additional Best Practices

5. **One Conversation at a Time**: Focus and listen
6. **Be Visual**: Sketch, diagram, demonstrate
7. **Stay Focused**: Keep returning to the challenge
8. **Time-Box**: Constraints drive creativity

## The Diverge-Converge Model

```
   DIVERGE                              CONVERGE
   Generate ideas                       Select ideas
        \                                  /
         \                                /
          \                              /
           \          GROAN             /
            \         ZONE             /
             \                        /
              ──────────────────────────

   • Quantity        • Quality
   • Expansive       • Focused
   • No judgment     • Evaluation
   • All ideas       • Best ideas
```

The "Groan Zone" is the challenging transition between divergence and convergence.

## Divergent Techniques

### 1. Classic Brainstorm
Free-flowing idea generation with one person capturing.

### 2. Brainwriting (6-3-5)
- 6 people write 3 ideas in 5 minutes
- Pass papers and build on others' ideas
- Repeat rounds

### 3. Round Robin
Each person contributes one idea in turn, building momentum.

### 4. Mind Mapping
Visual technique branching from central concept.

### 5. SCAMPER
Systematic modification prompts:
- **S**ubstitute
- **C**ombine
- **A**dapt
- **M**odify
- **P**ut to other use
- **E**liminate
- **R**everse

### 6. Random Entry
Use random words/images as stimulus for new connections.

### 7. Reverse Brainstorm
"How could we cause this problem?" then flip solutions.

### 8. Starbursting
Generate questions (Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?) rather than answers.

### 9. Role Storming
Brainstorm as someone else (customer, competitor, child).

### 10. Worst Possible Idea
Deliberately generate terrible ideas, then extract useful elements.

## Convergent Techniques

### 1. Dot Voting
Each person gets N dots to distribute among ideas.

### 2. Affinity Mapping
Group related ideas into themes/clusters.

### 3. Four Categories
Sort ideas into: Now, Soon, Later, Never

### 4. Impact/Effort Matrix
Plot ideas on 2x2 grid.

### 5. Ranking
Force-rank top 5-10 ideas.

### 6. Criteria Weighting
Score ideas against predefined criteria.

### 7. Thumbs Up/Down
Quick consensus check.

## Session Structures

### Quick Burst (30 minutes)
```
00:00 - 00:05  Setup & Rules
00:05 - 00:15  Diverge (generate ideas)
00:15 - 00:25  Converge (group & vote)
00:25 - 00:30  Close (top 3 & next steps)
```

### Standard Session (60 minutes)
```
00:00 - 00:05  Setup & Rules
00:05 - 00:10  Warm-up / Energizer
00:10 - 00:25  Round 1: Free Brainstorm
00:25 - 00:35  Round 2: Prompted/Structured
00:35 - 00:45  Group & Theme
00:45 - 00:55  Vote & Prioritize
00:55 - 00:60  Close & Actions
```

### Extended Session (90 minutes)
```
00:00 - 00:10  Setup & Context
00:10 - 00:15  Warm-up
00:15 - 00:30  Round 1: Individual Silent
00:30 - 00:45  Round 2: Group Building
00:45 - 00:60  Round 3: Technique (SCAMPER, etc.)
00:60 - 00:70  Clustering & Themes
00:70 - 00:80  Voting & Discussion
00:80 - 00:90  Actions & Close
```

## Facilitation Tips

### Starting Strong
- Have a clear, well-framed challenge
- Create energy with a warm-up
- Post rules visibly
- Use a timer

### Maintaining Momentum
- Call out good examples of building
- Prompt when energy dips
- Change techniques if stuck
- Use provocations: "What if...?"

### Managing Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Silent group | Try brainwriting first |
| One dominant voice | Use round robin |
| Going off-topic | Restate the challenge |
| Premature criticism | Remind of rules, park concerns |
| Running out of ideas | Change technique or perspective |
| Too many ideas | Use affinity mapping |

### Closing Strong
- Celebrate quantity generated
- Make selection transparent
- Assign clear actions
- Thank participants

## Quality of Ideas

### Idea Attributes to Look For

**Novel**: Different from existing solutions
**Feasible**: Possible to implement
**Valuable**: Addresses the real need
**Complete**: Can stand alone as concept

### Characteristics of Good Sessions

- High quantity of ideas generated
- Diversity of idea types
- Some surprising/unexpected ideas
- Building on others' ideas visible
- Energy maintained throughout

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Production Blocking**: Others can't share while one talks
   - *Solution*: Use brainwriting or silent ideation first

2. **Evaluation Apprehension**: Fear of judgment
   - *Solution*: Emphasize rules, anonymous submission

3. **Social Loafing**: Hiding in the group
   - *Solution*: Individual ideation before group

4. **Anchoring**: Early ideas dominate
   - *Solution*: Generate silently first, randomize sharing

5. **Groupthink**: Converging too quickly
   - *Solution*: Extend divergence, assign devil's advocate
