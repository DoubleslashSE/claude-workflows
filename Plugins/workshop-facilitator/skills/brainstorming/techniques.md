# Brainstorming Techniques

Detailed guides for specific brainstorming methods.

## Divergent Techniques

### Technique: Brainwriting (6-3-5)

**Best For**: Balanced participation, introverts, avoiding anchoring

**Setup**:
- Paper/cards for each participant
- Timer
- Clear challenge statement visible

**Process**:
1. Each person writes 3 ideas (5 minutes)
2. Pass paper to the right
3. Read ideas, then add 3 more building on or new (5 minutes)
4. Repeat until papers return to original owner
5. Share highlights with group

**Output**: 6 people × 6 rounds × 3 ideas = 108 potential ideas

**Variations**:
- 6-3-5 Digital: Use shared doc, rotate sections
- Rapid 3-2-3: Faster rounds for energy

### Technique: Mind Mapping

**Best For**: Exploring topic dimensions, visual thinkers

**Setup**:
- Large paper or whiteboard
- Central topic clearly stated
- Markers

**Process**:
1. Write central topic in middle
2. Draw main branches for major themes
3. Add sub-branches for ideas
4. Connect related items across branches
5. Use colors and images

**Structure**:
```
                    [Sub-topic]
                        │
                   [Sub-topic]───[Detail]
                        │
    [Theme 1]───────────┼───────────[Theme 2]
         │              │               │
         │       [CENTRAL TOPIC]        │
         │              │               │
    [Theme 4]───────────┼───────────[Theme 3]
         │              │               │
    [Sub-topic]    [Sub-topic]     [Sub-topic]
```

### Technique: SCAMPER

**Best For**: Systematic exploration, building on existing ideas

**Process**:
For each letter, apply the lens to your topic:

#### S - Substitute
- What materials, components, or people could we substitute?
- What other process could we use?
- What if we changed the rules?

#### C - Combine
- What ideas could we combine?
- What could we merge or integrate?
- What if we combined purposes or objectives?

#### A - Adapt
- What else is like this?
- What could we copy from another industry?
- What ideas from the past could we adapt?

#### M - Modify/Magnify/Minimize
- What could we enlarge or make smaller?
- What could we exaggerate or understate?
- What could we add or streamline?

#### P - Put to Other Uses
- What else could this be used for?
- Who else could use this?
- How would a child/elder/expert use this?

#### E - Eliminate
- What could we remove?
- What's not necessary?
- What if we did less?

#### R - Reverse/Rearrange
- What if we reversed the order?
- What if we swapped roles?
- What if we did the opposite?

### Technique: Random Entry/Forced Connections

**Best For**: Breaking mental blocks, fresh perspectives

**Setup**:
- Random word list or image cards
- Timer

**Process**:
1. Select random word/image
2. List attributes of the random element
3. Force connections to your challenge
4. Generate ideas from connections

**Example**:
- Challenge: "Improve employee onboarding"
- Random word: "Garden"
- Attributes: Growth, seasons, nurturing, roots, sunlight, weeding
- Forced connections:
  - Growth → Progressive skill development
  - Seasons → Quarterly check-ins
  - Nurturing → Mentor program
  - Roots → Deep company culture immersion
  - Sunlight → Transparent information access
  - Weeding → Removing obstacles

### Technique: Reverse Brainstorm

**Best For**: Uncovering hidden assumptions, seeing problems differently

**Process**:
1. State the challenge normally
2. Flip it: "How could we cause this problem?" or "How could we make this worse?"
3. Generate reverse ideas enthusiastically
4. Flip each reverse idea back
5. Evaluate the positive versions

**Example**:
- Challenge: "How might we improve customer service?"
- Reversed: "How could we make customer service terrible?"
  - Make customers wait hours
  - Use confusing phone menus
  - Give inconsistent answers
  - Make it hard to reach humans
- Flipped back:
  - Respond within minutes
  - Simple, direct contact options
  - Consistent, documented answers
  - Easy human access

### Technique: Role Storming

**Best For**: New perspectives, overcoming blocks

**Setup**:
- List of personas/characters

**Personas to Try**:
- Your best customer
- Your harshest critic
- A 5-year-old child
- Someone from 1900 / 2100
- A competitor
- A celebrity
- An expert from another field
- The CEO
- The front-line employee

**Process**:
1. Select a persona
2. Get into character mentally
3. Brainstorm as that person would
4. Capture ideas without judgment
5. Repeat with different personas

## Convergent Techniques

### Technique: Dot Voting

**Best For**: Democratic, quick prioritization

**Setup**:
- All ideas visible on wall/board
- Dot stickers (or markers) - typically 3-5 per person

**Process**:
1. Review all ideas briefly
2. Give each person N dots
3. Vote silently (can put multiple on one idea)
4. Count dots
5. Discuss top vote-getters

**Variations**:
- Weighted voting: Different colored dots for different criteria
- Secret voting: Vote on paper first, then reveal
- $100 voting: Allocate "money" across ideas

### Technique: Affinity Mapping

**Best For**: Making sense of many ideas, finding themes

**Process**:
1. Spread all ideas out
2. Silently move similar ideas together
3. Don't discuss during clustering
4. Repeat until stable
5. Name each cluster
6. Discuss relationships between clusters

**Tips**:
- Let outliers remain unclustered if they don't fit
- Clusters of 3-7 items work well
- Names should capture essence, not just list

### Technique: Impact/Effort Matrix

**Best For**: Practical prioritization, action planning

**Setup**:
```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
    ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
    │                    │                    │
    │  MAJOR PROJECTS    │    QUICK WINS      │
    │                    │                    │
    │  Worth doing but   │    DO FIRST        │
    │  plan carefully    │                    │
    │                    │                    │
HIGH├────────────────────┼────────────────────┤LOW
EFFORT                   │                    EFFORT
    │                    │                    │
    │   MONEY PITS       │    FILL-INS        │
    │                    │                    │
    │   Avoid unless     │    Do if time      │
    │   strategic        │    permits         │
    │                    │                    │
    └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

**Process**:
1. Draw 2x2 matrix
2. Place each idea based on:
   - Impact: Effect on the goal
   - Effort: Resources required
3. Focus on Quick Wins first
4. Plan Major Projects carefully
5. Consider Fill-Ins opportunistically
6. Avoid Money Pits

### Technique: Criteria Weighting

**Best For**: Objective evaluation, complex decisions

**Setup**:
- Define 3-5 criteria
- Assign weight to each (totaling 100%)

**Example Criteria**:
| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Customer impact | 30% |
| Feasibility | 25% |
| Cost | 20% |
| Strategic fit | 15% |
| Speed to implement | 10% |

**Process**:
1. Score each idea 1-5 on each criterion
2. Multiply score by weight
3. Sum weighted scores
4. Rank by total score
5. Discuss surprises

**Template**:
| Idea | Customer (30%) | Feasibility (25%) | Cost (20%) | Strategy (15%) | Speed (10%) | Total |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| A | 4 (1.2) | 3 (0.75) | 4 (0.8) | 5 (0.75) | 3 (0.3) | 3.8 |
| B | 5 (1.5) | 2 (0.5) | 2 (0.4) | 4 (0.6) | 2 (0.2) | 3.2 |

### Technique: Now/Next/Later/Never

**Best For**: Action-oriented planning

**Categories**:
- **Now**: Start immediately (this week)
- **Next**: Start soon (this month)
- **Later**: Backlog (this quarter+)
- **Never**: Don't pursue (archive)

**Process**:
1. Present each idea briefly
2. Quick vote or discussion: which category?
3. Place in appropriate column
4. Review "Now" items for actions
5. Document "Next" items for future
6. Archive "Never" with brief rationale
