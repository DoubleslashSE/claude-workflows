# Questioning Techniques for Facilitation

Detailed frameworks for asking effective questions in workshops.

## The Power of Questions

Good questions:
- Open thinking, not close it
- Invite reflection
- Don't contain the answer
- Create space for genuine exploration

## Question Types & When to Use Them

### 1. Opening Questions

**Purpose**: Start conversations, introduce topics, create engagement.

**When to Use**: Beginning of sessions, introducing new topics, after breaks.

**Examples**:
- "What comes to mind when you think about [topic]?"
- "What's your experience with [topic]?"
- "If you could solve one thing about [topic], what would it be?"
- "What drew you to participate today?"
- "What would make this session valuable for you?"

**Tips**:
- Keep it simple and accessible
- Ensure everyone can answer
- Start with personal experience, not abstract concepts

### 2. Exploratory Questions

**Purpose**: Go deeper, understand context, uncover nuance.

**When to Use**: After initial responses, when you sense more underneath.

**Examples**:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What led you to that conclusion?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What does that look like in practice?"
- "When has that been different?"
- "What else?"

**The "5 Whys" Technique**:
Keep asking "Why?" (or "What causes that?") to get to root causes:
1. Why is X happening? → Because of Y
2. Why Y? → Because of Z
3. Why Z? → Because of A
4. Why A? → Because of B
5. Why B? → Root cause: C

### 3. Clarifying Questions

**Purpose**: Resolve ambiguity, ensure understanding, align definitions.

**When to Use**: When terms are vague, when you're confused, when group seems misaligned.

**Examples**:
- "Help me understand what you mean by [term]."
- "When you say [X], do you mean [A] or [B]?"
- "Can you say more about what you mean?"
- "What would that actually look like?"
- "How would we know if that was happening?"

**Paraphrasing Pattern**:
"So if I understand correctly, you're saying [restatement]. Is that right?"

### 4. Probing Questions

**Purpose**: Challenge assumptions, test reasoning, go deeper.

**When to Use**: When answers seem surface-level, when assumptions go unstated.

**Examples**:
- "What makes you say that?"
- "What evidence supports that?"
- "What assumptions are we making here?"
- "How do we know that's true?"
- "What if that assumption were wrong?"
- "What are we not seeing?"

**Assumption Testing**:
- "We seem to be assuming [X]. Should we test that?"
- "What would need to be true for that to work?"
- "What could prove this wrong?"

### 5. Connecting Questions

**Purpose**: Link ideas, find patterns, build on contributions.

**When to Use**: When ideas are fragmented, to show you're listening.

**Examples**:
- "How does that connect to what [name] said earlier?"
- "I'm noticing a pattern—[name] mentioned X, and you're talking about Y. What's the link?"
- "What's the relationship between [A] and [B]?"
- "Are these the same idea or different?"
- "How might we combine these?"

### 6. Reflective Questions

**Purpose**: Encourage synthesis, identify patterns, create insight.

**When to Use**: After activities, before transitions, during synthesis.

**Examples**:
- "What patterns do you notice?"
- "What surprised you?"
- "What's becoming clearer?"
- "What's still unclear?"
- "How has your thinking changed?"
- "What's the key insight here?"
- "What's the story these ideas tell?"

### 7. Action Questions

**Purpose**: Move from thinking to doing, create commitment.

**When to Use**: During action planning, at close, when energy is building.

**Examples**:
- "What would it take to make this happen?"
- "What's the first step?"
- "Who needs to be involved?"
- "What's standing in the way?"
- "What would you need to feel confident moving forward?"
- "What will you do differently after today?"

### 8. Devil's Advocate Questions

**Purpose**: Test robustness, surface objections, avoid groupthink.

**When to Use**: When consensus comes too easily, before finalizing decisions.

**Examples**:
- "What could go wrong with this?"
- "If someone disagreed, what might they say?"
- "What are we missing?"
- "What's the case against this?"
- "Six months from now, what could we regret?"

**Framing**:
"Let me play devil's advocate for a moment. What if [counter-argument]?"

## Question Sequences

### Funnel Sequence
Start broad, then narrow:
1. "What's your general impression of [topic]?"
2. "Which aspects stand out most?"
3. "Tell me more about [specific aspect]."
4. "What's the core issue there?"

### Inverted Funnel
Start specific, then broaden:
1. "What happened in [specific situation]?"
2. "What does that tell us about [category]?"
3. "What does that mean more broadly?"
4. "What's the implication?"

### Problem-Solution Sequence
1. "What's the problem we're trying to solve?"
2. "Why does this problem exist?"
3. "What have we tried before?"
4. "What haven't we tried?"
5. "What could we do differently?"

### Before/After Sequence
1. "What's happening now?"
2. "What do we want to be happening?"
3. "What's the gap?"
4. "What would bridge that gap?"

## Facilitator Responses to Answers

### Acknowledgment Without Judgment
- "Thank you for sharing that."
- "That's an interesting perspective."
- "I appreciate you bringing that up."

(Avoid: "Great!" "Perfect!" "That's right!" which implies judgment)

### Building
- "Building on that idea..."
- "That connects to something [name] said..."
- "That opens up another angle..."

### Redirecting to Group
- "What do others think about that?"
- "Does anyone see it differently?"
- "How does that land with the group?"

### Parking
- "That's important. Let me capture it for later."
- "We'll come back to that. For now, let's stay focused on..."

## Questions to Avoid

### Leading Questions
❌ "Don't you think we should do X?"
✓ "What options do we have?"

### Loaded Questions
❌ "Why did you make such a poor decision?"
✓ "Walk me through your decision-making process."

### Multiple Questions
❌ "What happened, and why did it happen, and what should we do about it?"
✓ "Let's start with: what happened?"

### Binary Questions (Unless Needed)
❌ "Do you agree with this approach?"
✓ "What's your perspective on this approach?"

### Rhetorical Questions
❌ "Isn't it obvious that...?"
✓ State your observation directly, then ask for input.

## Managing Silence After Questions

Silence is productive. Wait before filling it.

**The 7-Second Rule**: Count to 7 after asking before speaking again.

**If Silence Persists**:
- "Take a moment to think about it."
- "I'll give you 30 seconds to jot down thoughts."
- "Let me rephrase: [simpler version]"
- "Start with anything—it doesn't need to be perfect."

## Culture Considerations

Different cultures have different norms around:
- Direct questioning
- Silence duration comfort
- Disagreeing publicly
- Speaking without being called on

Adapt by:
- Using written input before verbal
- Smaller group discussions
- Named turn-taking
- Anonymous input methods
