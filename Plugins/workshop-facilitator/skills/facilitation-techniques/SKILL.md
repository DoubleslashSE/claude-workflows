# Facilitation Techniques Skill

## Overview

Facilitation is the art of guiding groups through structured processes to achieve specific outcomes. Great facilitators create environments where people do their best thinking together.

## The Facilitator's Role

### What Facilitators Do
- Guide the process, not the content
- Create space for all voices
- Maintain focus and energy
- Capture and synthesize
- Ensure clear outcomes

### What Facilitators Don't Do
- Dominate the conversation
- Push their own ideas
- Allow one person to take over
- Let discussions drift endlessly
- Make decisions for the group

## Core Facilitation Skills

### 1. Active Listening

**Components**:
- Full attention (no multitasking)
- Non-verbal acknowledgment (nodding, eye contact)
- Verbal acknowledgment ("I hear you...")
- Reflecting back ("So what you're saying is...")
- Clarifying ("Help me understand...")

**Phrases**:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "Let me make sure I understand..."
- "That's interesting—can you elaborate?"

### 2. Powerful Questions

**Types of Questions**:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Opening | Introduce topic | "What comes to mind when you think about...?" |
| Probing | Go deeper | "Why do you think that is?" |
| Clarifying | Resolve ambiguity | "What do you mean by...?" |
| Challenging | Test assumptions | "What if that weren't true?" |
| Connecting | Find links | "How does that relate to what [name] said?" |
| Reflective | Encourage thinking | "What patterns do you see?" |
| Action | Move forward | "What would it take to make that happen?" |

**Question Framing**:
- Start with "What" or "How" for exploration
- Avoid leading questions
- Ask one question at a time
- Allow silence after asking

### 3. Managing Energy

**Energy States**:
```
HIGH ENERGY
│
│  ■ Excited, chaotic  ←── Guide/focus
│  ■ Engaged, productive ←── Ideal zone
│  ■ Calm, reflective   ←── Good for synthesis
│  ■ Low, disengaged    ←── Energize
│
LOW ENERGY
```

**Energizers**:
- Change the format (sit → stand)
- Do a quick physical activity
- Use a provocative question
- Share something surprising
- Take a short break

**Calmers**:
- Quiet reflection time
- Written activities
- Deep breathing
- Reduce stimulation

### 4. Time Management

**Techniques**:
- Visible timer
- Time checks: "We have 10 minutes left for this section"
- Parking lot for off-topic items
- Hard stops announced in advance
- Buffer time built in

**When Running Over**:
- "We need to wrap up—any final thoughts?"
- "Let's capture this for later discussion"
- "Can we take this offline?"
- Negotiate: "Need 5 more minutes here; okay to shorten X?"

### 5. Managing Participation

**Balancing Voices**:

```
        PARTICIPATION SPECTRUM

Dominant ◄────────────────────────► Silent
Voice                               Voice
   │                                   │
   └─── Manage ────┐    ┌── Draw out ──┘
                   ▼    ▼
              BALANCED
              PARTICIPATION
```

**For Dominant Voices**:
- "Thank you, [name]. Let's hear from others."
- "I want to get a few more perspectives."
- Direct questions to others by name
- Use structured formats (round robin, written)

**For Quiet Voices**:
- "I'd love to hear your thoughts, [name]."
- Use anonymous input methods
- Small group discussions first
- Written before verbal

### 6. Handling Difficult Situations

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Off-topic rambling | "Interesting—let me capture that for later. Back to our focus..." |
| Side conversations | "I want to make sure we hear this. One conversation please." |
| Conflict | "You both have valid points. Let's find the common ground." |
| Silence | Wait. Then: "Take a moment to think. I'll come back to you." |
| Negativity | "What concerns you? And what would address that?" |
| Domination | "I appreciate your engagement. Let's hear other perspectives." |
| Confusion | "Let me clarify. The question is..." |
| Tangent | "That's related. Let's park it and stay focused on X." |

## Session Structure

### The Arc of a Session

```
ENERGY
  │
  │        ┌─────────────────┐
  │       /                   \
  │      /                     \
  │     /                       \
  │    /                         \
  │   /                           \
  │  /                             \
  └─────────────────────────────────────
   Open    Build     Peak    Wind    Close
                             Down
```

### Opening Well

**Components**:
1. Welcome and introductions
2. Context setting (why we're here)
3. Objectives (what we'll achieve)
4. Agenda preview (how we'll work)
5. Ground rules (how we'll behave)
6. Questions/concerns

**Sample Opening**:
"Welcome everyone. Today we're here to [objective]. By the end of this session, we'll have [outcomes]. Here's our agenda: [overview]. Before we start, let's agree on some ground rules: [rules]. Any questions before we begin?"

### Closing Well

**Components**:
1. Summarize key outcomes
2. Confirm decisions made
3. Review action items
4. Identify next steps
5. Express appreciation
6. Gather feedback (optional)

**Sample Closing**:
"Let's recap what we accomplished: [summary]. Our key decisions are: [list]. Our action items are: [who/what/when]. Next steps include: [preview]. Thank you all for your participation. Any final thoughts?"

## Ground Rules

### Common Ground Rules
- One conversation at a time
- Respect all perspectives
- What's said here stays here
- Phones away/silent
- Full participation
- Time boundaries respected
- Build on ideas (Yes, and...)
- Focus on the challenge, not politics

### Establishing Rules
- Propose a set, ask for additions
- Or: Have group create their own
- Post visibly
- Reference when needed

## Capturing & Synthesizing

### Capture Techniques
- Sticky notes on walls
- Digital whiteboard
- Designated note-taker
- Recording (with permission)
- Flip charts

### Synthesis Techniques
- Read back key points periodically
- Cluster similar items
- Highlight patterns
- Summarize at transitions
- Final recap at close

### Capture Tips
- Use participant's words when possible
- Check understanding: "Did I capture that right?"
- Make capture visible to group
- Don't edit while capturing

## Virtual Facilitation

### Additional Considerations
- Technology check beforehand
- More structured turn-taking
- Shorter sessions (90 min max)
- More frequent breaks
- Use chat for parallel input
- Call on people by name
- Acknowledge technical challenges

### Tools for Virtual Sessions
- Video conferencing with breakouts
- Digital whiteboards (Miro, Mural, FigJam)
- Real-time polling
- Shared documents
- Chat for side thoughts

See [questioning.md](questioning.md) for detailed question frameworks.
